                    **P04_Raytrace**


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use any zip utility to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: generated images, screenshots).
Be sure to include all of the files, so that we can reproduce all of your images by running the ray tracer.

I have added example stuff below.
Replace it with meaningful content.

Reference Images

Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

<!-- ... -->



Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
-->

<!-- ... -->



<!--
Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.
-->
So far, I have worked on "Texture Mapping" feature. The program texture mapping one image on the sphere. My goal is to
make a sun galaxy somehow in the animation.
<!-- ... -->



<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

<!-- ... -->




Team Evaluation
================

<!--
Rank all team members, including yourself!
There should be a first place member; there should be a last place member.
No ties.
-->

1. <!-- first place member -->
2. <!-- second place member -->
3. <!-- third place member -->


<!--
Provide any details you would like to state that helps describe why you gave the ranking order above.
You may state something like, "Everyone really did contribute equally, and I ranked everyone as above because you made me do so."
Your evaluations will not be shared with your team members.
